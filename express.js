// library vs framework
// A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to optimize tasks. It provides specific functionality that can be called upon when needed, allowing developers to choose when and how to use it within their applications.
// A framework, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive structure that dictates the architecture of an application. It provides a foundation and set of rules for building applications, often requiring developers to follow its conventions and patterns.
// In summary, a library offers specific functionalities to be used as needed, while a framework provides a complete structure for building applications.
